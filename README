Ninja - version 1.0.0

Author: Tiziano Peraro

Ninja implements the Laurent series expansion method for the
computation of one-loop integrals. 

It is based on:

    "Integrand reduction of one-loop scattering amplitudes through
    Laurent series expansion,"
    JHEP 1206 (2012) 095  [arXiv:1203.0291 [hep-ph]].

Installing Ninja
----------------

Ninja can be compiled and installed with the commands

    ./configure
    make
    make install


In order to compile and link the built-in interface to the OneLoop
library use --with-avholo[=FLAGS] during configuration e.g.

    ./configure --with-avholo
    make
    make install

if OneLoop is installed in a standard directory, or

    ./configure --with-avholo='-L/path/to/avh_olo/lib -lavh_olo' \
        FCINCLUDE=-I/path/to/avh_olo/include
    make
    make install

if it is installed in /path/to/avh_olo/lib and the corresponding
Fortran90 module avh_olo is installed in /path/to/avh_olo/include.

NOTE: The OneLoop library can be obtained at
      http://helac-phegas.web.cern.ch/helac-phegas/OneLOop.html.  You
      should compile it as a dynamic library (see the file README of
      OneLoop for instructions).


In order to compile the built-in interface to the LoopTools library
use --with-looptools[=FLAGS] during configuration e.g.

    ./configure \
        --with-looptools='fldflags -L/path/to/looptools/lib -looptools' \
        CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/looptools/include
    make
    make install

where /path/to/looptools/ is the directory where LooTools is installed
and 'fldflags' stands for the additional flags the library requires
for static linking (you can find them e.g. in the file bin/fcc in the
main installation directory of LoopTools).  You can omit the FLAGS
argument of --with-looptools if you do not wish to compile the
examples.

NOTE: Ninja requires LoopTools-2.9 or later.  The LoopTools library
      can be obtained at http://www.feynarts.de/looptools.


For a full list of available options type

    ./configure --help

See the file INSTALL for more information about the installation
procedure.

If you specified the --prefix option for the configure scrip, you
should also add the directory where the library is installed to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (and DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on Mac OS) environment
variable, if not already present.  This is typically a sub-directory
lib/ or lib64/ of the one you specified with --prefix.



Installing the package NinjaNumGen
----------------------------------

The Python package NinjaNumGen can be used both as a Python module and
as a script in order to generate the input needed for Ninja.  It can
be installed using the command

    python setup.py install

in the utils/ directory.  The command
    
    python setup.py --help

will give a list of installation options.  If you specified the
--prefix option during installation, update your PATH and PYTHONPATH
environment variables accordingly.

note: NinjaNumGen requires Form-4 or later.  You can obtain Form at
      http://www.nikhef.nl/~form
