Ninja - version 1.0.0

Author: Tiziano Peraro

Ninja implements the Laurent series expansion method for the
computation of one-loop integrals. 

It is based on:

    P. Mastrolia, E. Mirabella and T. Peraro,
    "Integrand reduction of one-loop scattering amplitudes through
    Laurent series expansion,"
    JHEP 1206 (2012) 095  [arXiv:1203.0291 [hep-ph]].

It can be compiled and installed with the commands

    ./configure
    make
    make install

In order to compile and link the built-in interface to the OneLoop
library use --with-avholo[=FLAGS] during configuration e.g.

    ./configure --with-avholo='-L/path/to/avh_olo -lavh_olo'
    make
    make install

In order to compile the built-in interface to the LoopTools library
use --with-looptools[=FLAGS] during configuration e.g.

    ./configure --with-looptools='-L/path/to/looptools -looptools'
    make
    make install

note: since LoopTools is a static library, you will also need to link
your executables with it.

For a full list of available options type

    ./configure --help

The Python package NinjaNumGen can be used both as a Python module and
as a script in order to generate the input needed for Ninja.  You can
install it with

    cd utils
    python setup.py install

The command
    
    python setup.py --help

will give a list of installation options.
